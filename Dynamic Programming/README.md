# Dynamic Programming for solving some problems

## Longest Common Subsequence:

```
* recursive_lcs.cpp - Recursive approach to show overlapping subproblems
* dp_lcs.cpp - Dynamic programming bottom-up approach
* print_lcs.cpp - Dynamic programming bottom-up approach with printing the LCS
```

## Longest Palindrome Subsequence (Variation of the above problem to find palindrome in sequence):

```
* recursive_lps.cpp - Recursive approach to show overlapping subproblems
* dp_lps.cpp - Dynamic programming bottom-up approach
* print_lps.cpp - Dynamic programming bottom-up approach with printing the LPS
```
